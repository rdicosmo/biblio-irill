  retyping functions, are well-typed eta-expansions of the identity. {T}hey
  may change the type of terms without changing their behavior and can thus
  be erased before reduction.  Coercions in {F}-eta can model subtyping of
  known types and some displacement of quantifiers, but not subtyping
  assumptions nor certain form of delayed type instantiation. We generalize
  F-eta by allowing abstraction over retyping functions. We follow a general
  approach where computing with coercions can be seen as computing in the
  lambda-calculus but keeping track of which parts of terms are
  coercions. We obtain a language where coercions do not contribute to the
  reduction but may block it and are thus not erasable. We recover erasable
  coercions by choosing a weak reduction strategy and restricting coercion
  abstraction to value-forms or by restricting abstraction to coercions that
  are polymorphic in their domain or codomain. The latter variant subsumes
  {F}-eta, {F}-sub, and {MLF} in a unified framework.},

  information that can easily be maintained during reduction. All parameters
  of functions are explicitly typed and both type abstraction and type
  instantiation are explicit. However, type instantiation in xMLF is more
  general than type application in System F. We equip xMLF with a small-step
  reduction semantics that allows reduction in any context and show that this
  relation is confluent and type preserving. We also show that both subject
  reduction and progress hold for weak-reduction strategies, including
  call-by-value with the value-restriction.}

  title = {Supporting Software Evolution in Component-Based FOSS Systems},
  abstract = {FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) systems present interesting challenges in system evolution. On one hand, most FOSS systems are based on very fine-grained units of soft- ware deployment—called packages—which promote system evolution; on the other hand, FOSS systems are among the largest software systems known and require sophisticated static and dynamic conditions to be verified, in order to successfully deploy upgrades on user machines. The slightest error in one of these conditions can turn a routine upgrade into a system administrator nightmare. In this paper we introduce a model-based approach to support the upgrade of FOSS systems. The approach promotes the simulation of upgrades to predict failures before affecting the real system. Both fine-grained static aspects (e.g. configuration incoher- ences) and dynamic aspects (e.g. the execution of configuration scripts) are taken into account, improving over the state of the art of upgrade planners. The effectiveness of the approach is validated by instantiating the approach to widely-used FOSS distributions.},

State-of-the-art package managers are monolithic in architecture, and each of them is hard-wired to an ad-hoc dependency solver implementing a customized heuristics. In this paper we propose a modular architecture allowing for pluggable dependency solvers and backends. We argue that this is the path that leads to the next generation of package managers that will deliver better results, accept more expressive input languages, and can be easily adaptable to new platforms. We present a working prototype—called MPM—which has been implemented following the design advocated in this paper.},

  abstract = {Inter-package conflicts require the presence of two or more packages in a particular configuration, and thus tend to be harder to detect and localize than conventional (intra-package) defects. Hundreds of such inter-package conflicts go undetected by the normal testing and distribution process until they are later reported by a user. The reason for this is that current meta-data is not fine-grained and accurate enough to cover all common types of conflicts. A case study of inter-package conflicts in Debian has shown that with more detailed package meta-data, at least one third of all package conflicts could be prevented relatively easily, while another one third could be found by targeted testing of packages that share common resources or characteristics. This paper reports the case study and proposes ideas to detect inter-package conflicts in the future.},

  title = {Enforcing Type-Safe Linking using Inter-Package Relationships},
  abstract = {Strongly-typed languages rely on link-time checks to ensure that type safety is not violated at the borders of compilation units. Such checks entail very fine-grained dependencies among compilation units, which are at odds with the implicit assumption of backward compatibility that is relied upon by common library packaging techniques adopted by FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) package-based distributions. As a consequence, package managers are often unable to prevent users to install a set of libraries which cannot be linked together. We discuss how to guarantee link-time compatibility using inter-package relationships; in doing so, we take into account real-life maintainability problems such as support for automatic package rebuild and manageability of ABI (Application Binary Interface) strings by humans. We present the dh_ocaml implementation of the proposed solution, which is currently in use in the Debian distribution to safely deploy more than 300 OCaml-related packages.},

  abstract  = {    Modern software systems, like GNU/Linux distributions or Eclipse-based
    development environment, are often deployed by selecting components out of
    large component repositories. Maintaining such software systems by
    performing component upgrades is a complex task, and the users need to have
    an expressive preferences language at their disposal to specify the kind of
    upgrades they are interested in. Recent research has shown that it is
    possible to develop solvers that handle preferences expressed as a
    combination of a few basic criteria used in the MISC competition, ranging
    from the number of new components to the freshness of the final
    configuration. In this work we introduce a set of new criteria that allow
    the users to specify their preferences for solutions with components aligned
    to the same upstream sources, provide an efficient encoding and report on
    the experimental results that prove that optimising these alignment criteria
    is a tractable problem in practice.}

  title = {A Modular Package Manager Architecture},
  abstract = {The success of modern software distributions in the Free and Open Source world can be explained, among other factors, by the availability of a large collection of software packages and the possibility to easily install and remove those components using state of the art package managers. However, package managers are often built using a monolithic architecture and hard-wired and ad-hoc dependency solvers implementing some customized heuristics. In this paper we propose a modular architecture relying on precise interface formalisms that allows the system administrator to choose from a variety of dependency solvers and backends. We argue that this is the path that leads to the next generation of package managers that will deliver better results, offer more expressive preference languages, and be easily adaptable to new platforms. We have built a working prototype—called MPM—following the design advocated in this paper, and we show how it largely outperforms a variety of state of the art package managers.},

  title = {Dependency Solving: a Separate Concern in Component Evolution Management},
  abstract = {Maintenance of component-based software platforms often has to face rapid evolution of software components. Component dependencies, conflicts, and package managers with dependency solving capabilities are the key ingredients of prevalent software maintenance technologies that have been proposed to keep software installations synchronized with evolving component repositories. We review state-of-the-art package managers and their ability to keep up with evolution at the current growth rate of popular component-based platforms, and conclude that their dependency solving abilities are not up to the task. We show that the complexity of the underlying upgrade planning problem is NP-complete even for seemingly simple component models, and argue that the principal source of complexity lies in multiple available versions of components. We then discuss the need of expressive languages for user preferences, which makes the problem even more challenging. We propose to establish dependency solving as a separate concern from other upgrade aspects, and present CUDF as a formalism to describe upgrade scenarios. By analyzing the result of an international dependency solving competition, we provide evidence that the proposed approach is viable.},

In order to make a complete analysis of all possible futures effective however, one needs a way to construct a finite set of representatives of this infinite set of potential futures. We define a class of properties for which this can be done. We illustrate the practical usefulness of the approach with two quality assurance applications: (i) establishing the amount of "forced upgrades" induced by introducing new versions of existing components in a repository, and (ii) identifying outdated components that need to be upgraded in order to ever be installable in the future. For both applications we provide experience reports obtained on the Debian distribution.},

  title = {A Modular Package Manager Architecture},
  abstract = {The success of modern software distributions in the Free and Open Source world can be explained, among other factors, by the availability of a large collection of software packages and the possibility to easily install and remove those components using state of the art package managers. However, package managers are often built using a monolithic architecture and hard-wired and ad-hoc dependency solvers implementing some customized heuristics. In this paper we propose a modular architecture relying on precise interface formalisms that allows the system administrator to choose from a variety of dependency solvers and backends. We argue that this is the path that leads to the next generation of package managers that will deliver better results, offer more expressive preference languages, and be easily adaptable to new platforms. We have built a working prototype—called MPM—following the design advocated in this paper, and we show how it largely outperforms a variety of state of the art package managers.},

  title = {Dependency Solving: a Separate Concern in Component Evolution Management},
  abstract = {Maintenance of component-based software platforms often has to face rapid evolution of software components. Component dependencies, conflicts, and package managers with dependency solving capabilities are the key ingredients of prevalent software maintenance technologies that have been proposed to keep software installations synchronized with evolving component repositories. We review state-of-the-art package managers and their ability to keep up with evolution at the current growth rate of popular component-based platforms, and conclude that their dependency solving abilities are not up to the task. We show that the complexity of the underlying upgrade planning problem is NP-complete even for seemingly simple component models, and argue that the principal source of complexity lies in multiple available versions of components. We then discuss the need of expressive languages for user preferences, which makes the problem even more challenging. We propose to establish dependency solving as a separate concern from other upgrade aspects, and present CUDF as a formalism to describe upgrade scenarios. By analyzing the result of an international dependency solving competition, we provide evidence that the proposed approach is viable.},
